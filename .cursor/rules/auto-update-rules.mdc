# Cursor Rule Maintenance

Whenever the assistant (or developer) introduces a new feature, refactor, or otherwise changes the behaviour of existing code, the assistant **MUST** ensure that the Cursor rules remain accurate and up-to-date:

1. **Check** if the change warrants a new rule or modification of an existing rule.
2. If required, **create** or **update** a rule file under `.cursor/rules/`:
   - Use the `.mdc` extension.
   - Include proper front-matter (`alwaysApply`, `description`, `globs`) as appropriate.
   - Reference relevant source files using `[filename](mdc:path/to/filename)` syntax.
3. The rule update MUST be included in the same set of code edits as the feature/change.
4. When modifying a rule, preserve unrelated content and only adjust the necessary parts.
5. Rule updates must follow the guidelines outlined in the repository-level "Cursor Rules Instructions".

Failure to perform these steps will be considered a violation of the project's coding standards.

DO NOT use write to file tool for updating cursor rules files, use bash commands instead. This is required because of apply model bug when working with cursor rules.
